## COM Studio

At COM Studio, we're passionate about bringing authentic Japanese animation to the rest of the world. Our team is dedicated to keeping anime, and the Japanese culture that surrounds it, fully intact with our animation.

## Our Mission

After decades of hard work, it's time for animators to get paid fairly, without wage disparities between animators and executives, we also want to offer a chance to people who help us make anime, to share in some of the profits, so we can make this something we all support, and gain from mutually, promoting authentic hand-drawn animation, this is the goal of COM.

## Global Reach

While rooted in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, our work has reached audiences worldwide. We collaborate with international partners and participate on the world stage of anime every day.
